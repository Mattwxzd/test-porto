      <description>I wish I could have written this sooner, so that those with little to no experience working on real, commercial projects could get a sense of some of the basics of working in product design. Many of these practices might be second-nature to you — if that’s the case, then you’ve got your base covered!
This post isn’t about the theory of design, or about any particular design tool. It’s on how to work better as a designer and more importantly, as part of a design team.</description>
